GREP AUDIT FINDINGS:
====================

CRITICAL ISSUES:
----------------

1. DIRECTORY NAME - /workspace/bismark/

   - Should be renamed to "bismarck"
   - This is the PRIMARY directory containing all the application code

2. DOCKER IMAGE REFERENCES:
   - docker/build-mock.sh: Uses "bismark-agent-mock:test" 
   - src/main/dev-test-harness.ts: References "bismark-agent-mock:test"
   - src/main/plan-manager.ts: Uses "bismark-agent:latest"

FILES WITH "BISMARK" INSTANCES (excluding directory name):

6. ./docker/build-mock.sh
   - BISMARK_TASK_ID environment variable

7. ./docker/mock-claude.js
   - BISMARCK_TASK_ID environment variable (note: this one has the C!)

8. ./scripts/install.sh
   - "Building Bismark...", "~/Applications/Bismark.app"

9. ./scripts/test/cdp-server.js
   - "/tmp/claude/bismark-screenshot.png"

10. ./scripts/test/cdp-helper.js
    - Comments: "CDP Helper for Bismark Testing"
    - Window state: "__BISMARK_STATE__"

11. ./scripts/test/dev-with-cdp.js

14. ./src/main/dev-test-harness.ts
    - BISMARK_MOCK_AGENTS environment variable
    - bismark-ready label references (multiple)
    - /tmp/bismark-mock-plans/ path
    - "bismark-agent-mock:test" image
    - Variable name: "bismarkPlan"

15. ./src/main/plan-manager.ts
    - DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME: "bismark-agent:latest"
    - Feature branch pattern: "bismark/{id}/feature"
    - Multiple instruction templates with "[BISMARK ...]" headers
    - bismark-ready, bismark-sent labels
    - Task ID pattern: "bismark-xyz.N"
    - Branch naming: "bismark/{planId}"

SUMMARY:
========
- Build: ✓ Successful
- Main directory: ✗ Still named "bismark"
- Code references: Many instances of "bismark" found
- Most critical: Directory name and Docker image references
- Many environment variables, labels, and paths use "bismark"

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
The rename is incomplete. While package.json and source code may have been
updated in some places, there are still many references throughout the codebase
that use "bismark" instead of "bismarck".
